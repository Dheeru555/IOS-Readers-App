# IOS-Readers-App
This app will test the user’s reading speed. The app will display a paragraph of text (selected at random) one word at a time. The words will be displayed with a pause that corresponds to the given speed in words per minute. It displays the middle character of each word in a different color (if odd & even character different colours). If the app is used for the first time, then the user’s name will be entered and stored internally. The app should use a Tab View Controller with three tabs.
